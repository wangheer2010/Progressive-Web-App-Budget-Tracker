  ## Description
    
Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information at any time is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to the success of an application that handles usersâ€™ financial information.

This app is to add functionality to an existing budget tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality. The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, they can update the total when brought back online. 

To be more specific, our story is as follows.

    AS AN avid traveller
    I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
    SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling

Our application is deployed using Heroku.
